This theory was begotten of the recent media blurbs by showrunners DampD that the Night King is like a figure of Death and the supposed hypocrisy that GRRM does not right cartoonish Dark Lords with the motivation of just wanting to kill and be evil but may have written one with the Night King. It explains how that is not the case and reconciles The most fucked up, bizarre, nsfw, disgusting, weird movies I've seen to date.
